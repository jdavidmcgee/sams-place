						I'm Sam, a 4 year old Lab mix. I love to play fetch
						(well...not really - it's more like keep away), go on walks
						with 'the ruler of the known world' (at least that's what he
						thinks! Get some therapy man and get over yourself!), and chew
						on my various nylabone chews. I'm fairly protective of my
						chews, except when my sisters have them...then I whine like a
						baby!
					</p>
					<p>
						Squirrels and turtles are my...well I don't know what you'd
						call them - maybe friends? I believe I am a great companion
						and emotional support dog! Now sometimes I do get a bit scared
						- especially if a cat is around - so I'll rely on you to
						comfort me. This is my sneaky way to help you feel
						better...since we all know that if you help another you're
						really helping yourself! See...I'm a genius!

					<h4>2021</h4>
					<p>
						I find myself in Texas surrounded by my new family - and there
						are cats...three of them! I've also discovered two other dogs
						in my new home - puppies like me. One is named 'Cookie' and
						she's a bit hyper and kooky. OMG! Calm down sis! The other one
						is 'Missy' and my mom says "she's the cutest thing ever!"
						Aaaah...wait what!? - I thought I was 'the cutest thing ever!'
						I'll have to watch this. Maybe we'll be the bestest of
						friends...Cookie really scares me though and Missy seems to
						prefer only three of her four legs as she walks - weird. Hey I
						can count! How did that happen?

					<h4>2022</h4>
					<p>
						My dad seems to like to walk and takes me with him...all the
						time. It's a bit scary since there are lots of other dogs that
						could be my friends...but some don't act like it! There are
						also cats, ducks, snakes and squirrels! Yikes! Last night we
						saw some deer - they were nice but didn't say much. This thing
						my mom calls 'COVID' seems to be calming down...so my friends
						in the neighborhood are a bit more engaging. Wow...where did I
						learn to use such pristine words like 'engaging'? What's
						'pristine' mean? I must be pretty smart!

						I'm hitting my stride. The house is mine, my sisters have
						found that I'm the 'big deal' and they aren't...so they hang
						with mom. Cookie still thinks she's the boss - I'll eventually
						have to deal with this. I've discovered this thing called
						'chews' - you try and try to eat them and they never seem to
						go away! My sisters like them too but I wish they didn't. When
						they have them I get really sad...unfortunately a few tears
						have been shed because of this. My dad says "I need to learn
						to share." What's that?! Is that another chew thingy?!

						100lbs! My master trainer still keeps me out of the kitchen
						when he's cooking. My sisters are still a bit twisted...don't
						get me started! Turtles seem to like coming to visit, but they
						won't talk to me. When I get close they go inside their home
						and won't come out - no matter how much I knock on their door!

							<p>
								What am I supposed to do with the cat? Cat's are
								weird...they don't like to play with me. They have these
								things called 'claws' and they don't like me to chase
								them. I'm not sure why...I'm just trying to help them
								get some exercise! I'm a great personal trainer! I know
								that's not the service we're talking about right now, so
								let me get back to the point. Cat's don't seem to play
								nice with me, even when I'm trying to be nice to them.
								I'm not sure why they don't like me...I'm a great guy! I
								love licking their fur - tastes like chicken!
							</p>
							<p>
								As you can see my friend, Mr. Keegan, thinks this
								footrest is his place - clearly it's mine! I'm not sure
								why he thinks he can just come in and take over my
								space...I'm a bit confused by this. I am quite scared of
								him...but let's not tell him that!
							</p>
							<p>
								The other day I was trying to sleep - don't tell mom and
								dad since I was supposed to be baby sitting - and Mr.
								Keegan came over to say 'hello.' Well I was trying to
								sleep...and he's bothering me! Can a baby sitter tell a
								cat to go away?
							</p>
							<p>
								I don't seem to really understand the rules of baby
								sitting that well. I wish they'd stop asking me to do
								this, but I'm a trooper and will do my best. I know my
								services say 'baby sitter' but I just want to be clear -
								Mr. Keegan is NOT a baby! He's older than me and
								frankly, I think he's a bit of a bully! I'm just saying!
							</p>
							<p>
								Maybe I should revise my services to be explicit that I
								only take care of babies...not cats! I'm a dog...not a
								cat sitter! I understand that sometimes "when the world
								gives you lemons..." you're supposed to make lemonade!
								But I don't like lemonade! I like water (and coffee and
								tea)! I get in trouble sometimes when I try to drink my
								mom's coffee, but she leaves it out and it is soooo
								good! Finders keepers.
							</p>
							<p>I've got to run...I think I hear Mr. Keegan coming!</p>

								This is one of my specialities! I'm a great bed maker!
								The key is to get the sheets all messed up...then I can
								lay on them and make them all nice and neat!
							</p>
							<p>
								Making a bed is an art and I consider myself a masterful
								artist. To make a bed properly one must take all the
								sheets and covers off the bed and then roll around on
								top of the mattress. This is the most important step in
								the process. Once the mattress is properly 'fluffed'
								then the sheets and covers can be put back on the bed.
							</p>
							<p>
								The other day mom caught me in the act of making the
								bed...she didn't seem to understand my process. She said
								I was 'making a mess' and 'not helping.' I'm not sure
								what she meant by that...I was just trying to help!
							</p>
							<p>
								My dad doesn't like me making the bed either, something
								about 'shedding' and 'dirty paws.' I'm not sure what
								he's talking about...I'm a clean dog! I take a bath
								every day...well, not really, but I do take a bath every
								once in a while. Any way what's this 'shedding' thing?
								My dad goes on and on about hair on the bed - how do we
								know it's not his hair?
							</p>
							<p>
								One of my favorite things to do is to lay on the bed
								after it's been made. I like to lay on the pillows and
								pretend I'm a person. Hey, I can be like my dad who
								seems to lay in bed for hours reading his 'books.' I'm
								not sure what he's reading, but it must be good...he's
								in there for hours! I'm a great reader too...I like to
								read the newspaper...I'm not sure what it says, but I
								like to lay on it and pretend I'm reading. Ok, the truth
								is I like to eat the newspaper...it's a great snack!
