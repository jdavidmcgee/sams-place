						I'm Sam, a 4 year old Lab mix. I love to play fetch
						(well...not really - it's more like keep away), go on walks
						with 'the ruler of the known world' (at least that's what he
						thinks! Get some therapy man and get over yourself!), and chew
						on my various nylabone chews. I'm fairly protective of my
						chews, except when my sisters have them...then I whine like a
						baby!
					</p>
					<p>
						Squirrels and turtles are my...well I don't know what you'd
						call them - maybe friends? I believe I am a great companion
						and emotional support dog! Now sometimes I do get a bit scared
						- especially if a cat is around - so I'll rely on you to
						comfort me. This is my sneaky way to help you feel
						better...since we all know that if you help another you're
						really helping yourself! See...I'm a genius!

					<h4>2021</h4>
					<p>
						I find myself in Texas surrounded by my new family - and there
						are cats...three of them! I've also discovered two other dogs
						in my new home - puppies like me. One is named 'Cookie' and
						she's a bit hyper and kooky. OMG! Calm down sis! The other one
						is 'Missy' and my mom says "she's the cutest thing ever!"
						Aaaah...wait what!? - I thought I was 'the cutest thing ever!'
						I'll have to watch this. Maybe we'll be the bestest of
						friends...Cookie really scares me though and Missy seems to
						prefer only three of her four legs as she walks - weird. Hey I
						can count! How did that happen?

					<h4>2022</h4>
					<p>
						My dad seems to like to walk and takes me with him...all the
						time. It's a bit scary since there are lots of other dogs that
						could be my friends...but some don't act like it! There are
						also cats, ducks, snakes and squirrels! Yikes! Last night we
						saw some deer - they were nice but didn't say much. This thing
						my mom calls 'COVID' seems to be calming down...so my friends
						in the neighborhood are a bit more engaging. Wow...where did I
						learn to use such pristine words like 'engaging'? What's
						'pristine' mean? I must be pretty smart!

						I'm hitting my stride. The house is mine, my sisters have
						found that I'm the 'big deal' and they aren't...so they hang
						with mom. Cookie still thinks she's the boss - I'll eventually
						have to deal with this. I've discovered this thing called
						'chews' - you try and try to eat them and they never seem to
						go away! My sisters like them too but I wish they didn't. When
						they have them I get really sad...unfortunately a few tears
						have been shed because of this. My dad says "I need to learn
						to share." What's that?! Is that another chew thingy?!

						Dad's still walks - so...I do too! Mom is slowly coming around
						that I'm a lap dog, even though my doctor says I weigh nearly
						100lbs! My master trainer still keeps me out of the kitchen
						when he's cooking. My sisters are still a bit twisted...don't
						get me started! Turtles seem to like coming to visit, but they
						won't talk to me. When I get close they go inside their home
						and won't come out - no matter how much I knock on their door!
