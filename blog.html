								dog! Right!?
							</p>
							<p>
								What am I supposed to do with the cat? Cat's are
								weird...they don't like to play with me. They have these
								things called 'claws' and they don't like me to chase
								them. I'm not sure why...I'm just trying to help them
								get some exercise! I'm a great personal trainer! I know
								that's not the service we're talking about right now, so
								let me get back to the point. Cat's don't seem to play
								nice with me, even when I'm trying to be nice to them.
								I'm not sure why they don't like me...I'm a great guy! I
								love licking their fur - tastes like chicken!
							</p>
							<p>
								As you can see my friend, Mr. Keegan, thinks this
								footrest is his place - clearly it's mine! I'm not sure
								why he thinks he can just come in and take over my
								space...I'm a bit confused by this. I am quite scared of
								him...but let's not tell him that!
							</p>
							<p>
								The other day I was trying to sleep - don't tell mom and
								dad since I was supposed to be baby sitting - and Mr.
								Keegan came over to say 'hello.' Well I was trying to
								sleep...and he's bothering me! Can a baby sitter tell a
								cat to go away?
							</p>
							<p>
								I don't seem to really understand the rules of baby
								sitting that well. I wish they'd stop asking me to do
								this, but I'm a trooper and will do my best. I know my
								services say 'baby sitter' but I just want to be clear -
								Mr. Keegan is NOT a baby! He's older than me and
								frankly, I think he's a bit of a bully! I'm just saying!
							</p>
							<p>
								Maybe I should revise my services to be explicit that I
								only take care of babies...not cats! I'm a dog...not a
								cat sitter! I understand that sometimes "when the world
								gives you lemons..." you're supposed to make lemonade!
								But I don't like lemonade! I like water (and coffee and
								tea)! I get in trouble sometimes when I try to drink my
								mom's coffee, but she leaves it out and it is soooo
								good! Finders keepers.
							</p>
							<p>I've got to run...I think I hear Mr. Keegan coming!</p>

									<h4>Making the bed</h4>
									<p>
										This is one of my specialities! I'm a great bed
										maker! The key is to get the sheets all messed
										up...then I can lay on them and make them all nice
										and neat!

								This is one of my specialities! I'm a great bed maker!

								lay on them and make them all nice and neat!
							</p>
							<p>
								Making a bed is an art and I consider myself a masterful
								artist. To make a bed properly one must take all the
								sheets and covers off the bed and then roll around on
								top of the mattress. This is the most important step in
								the process. Once the mattress is properly 'fluffed'
								then the sheets and covers can be put back on the bed.
							</p>
							<p>
								The other day mom caught me in the act of making the
								bed...she didn't seem to understand my process. She said
								I was 'making a mess' and 'not helping.' I'm not sure
								what she meant by that...I was just trying to help!
							</p>
							<p>
								My dad doesn't like me making the bed either, something
								about 'shedding' and 'dirty paws.' I'm not sure what
								he's talking about...I'm a clean dog! I take a bath
								every day...well, not really, but I do take a bath every
								once in a while. Any way what's this 'shedding' thing?
								My dad goes on and on about hair on the bed - how do we
								know it's not his hair?
							</p>
							<p>
								One of my favorite things to do is to lay on the bed
								after it's been made. I like to lay on the pillows and
								pretend I'm a person. Hey, I can be like my dad who
								seems to lay in bed for hours reading his 'books.' I'm
								not sure what he's reading, but it must be good...he's
								in there for hours! I'm a great reader too...I like to
								read the newspaper...I'm not sure what it says, but I
								like to lay on it and pretend I'm reading. Ok, the truth
								is I like to eat the newspaper...it's a great snack!

								The other day I was sitting on the back porch and had a
								thought. It seems like this could be a new thing for me
								- thinking! I was thinking about all the things I've
								done in my life and what I've learned.
							</p>
							<p>
								I've learned that I'm a great companion and emotional
								support dog. I've learned that I'm a great cleaner upper
								and that I'm a great bed maker. I've learned that I'm a
								great walker and that I'm a great listener. I've learned
								that I'm a great friend and that I'm a great baby
								sitter. I've learned that I'm a great thinker and that
								I'm a great...well, you get the idea!
							</p>
							<p>
								I notice I use the word 'great' a lot...I'm not sure
								why. My mom and dad tell me I'm a good boy all the time,
								so maybe I consider being a good boy means I must be
								'great!' I do like thinking I 'great.' I'm not sure what
								it means, but it sounds good! I'm a great thinker...I
								think! See it just kinda rolls off the tongue...say it
								with me, "I'm great!"
							</p>
							<p>
								I guess it beats the opposite. I mean I'd rather consider myself 'great' than 'not great.'  Right?! Great doesn't mean I'm the best...just that I'm great.  What if everyone else is great too?  That's ok by me!  I'm great and so are you!  I'm great and so are my sisters!  I'm great and so are my friends!  I'm great and so are my parents!  I'm great and so are my neighbors.  Sounds kinda good.
							</p>
							<p>
								It seems that lots of folks don't consider themselves great.  I wonder why that is.  Maybe they think being great must mean that one has to be 'the best.'  But what if that's not it at all!  What if being great means that you're just you...and that's great!  I like the thought of living in a world surrounded by people who think they're great...I think that would be great!  
							</p>
							<p>
								I wish we spent more time telling our friends how great they are!  I notice, when my mom and dad are watching TV, that so often folks are telling others how bad they are!  Who wants to live in a world where folks are telling you that you're bad all the time!  I don't!  I want to live in a world where folks are telling me that I'm great!  I want to live in a world where folks are telling each other that they love and appreciate each other...that who we are is just perfect.  That doesn't mean we can't improve...it just means that we're great just the way we are!  I think that would be great!
